Supposed to pass callbacks as the first argument.
- You can use arguments variable for ease of use arguments[0], arguments[1] or so

function callbackTester (callback) {
    callback (arguments[1], arguments[2]);
}

callbackTester (tryMe, "hello", "goodbye");

- event.preventDefault();



CSS tips - Setting properties to 'auto' is very dangerous as you are leaving them to computation relative to other elements.

- addressing an element more spevifically will override the not very specific css. e.g- Table tr will override just tr

In react it is good practice make granular focus component

- using 'classes' keyword from .css
